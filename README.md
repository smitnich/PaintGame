# PaintGame
In progress Unity3d twin-stick shooter where you fight enemies by firing paint at them.
The player has three gauges of energy: each one corresponds to one color of bullet fired by the player. More energy can be gathered by absorbing paint left on the ground.
Destroyed enemies will leave behind imprints of themselves, and bullets will create small splotches where they land.
